listless
========

Listless is a basic Android application for creating and managing simple lists of tasks. Although there are plans to add the functionality, there is currently no ordering of the lists or status of individual items on lists. Yes, it is that limited. Plus, I did the icons myself ... so that probably gives you some indication of how high the quality is.
